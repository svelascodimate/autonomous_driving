    "# Systematic Evaluation of Bugs in Software Defined Vehicles\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rapidly evolving landscape of transportation technology, Software Defined Vehicles (\\sdvs) promise enhanced safety, efficiency, and convenience. However, with their computing systems' heavy reliance on complex software stacks, SDVs also face significant challenges related to software bugs. Fixing and addressing software bugs, automatically assessing autonomous vehicles' behaviour correctness would directly improve reliability and safety of those vehicles. This study aims to create a systematic bug evaluation in SDVs to increase robustness of the software that is accelerating innovation on the road to full automation."

    "- `01_github_miner.ipynb`: Methods for mining issues from software repositories\n",
    "01_topic_modeling.ipynb -> Methods for topic modeling using SentenceBERT\n",
    "\n",
    "- `miner_nb.ipynb`: This is notebook designed to streamline the mining process. It's set up for immediate use, allowing you to execute the mining procedures with ease and precision.\n",
    "- `modeling_nb.ipynb`: This notebook is dedicated to executing the topic modeling process. It also contains the visualization of the embeddings. \n",

    "- **Robust GitHub Mining**: Leveraging the power of the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues?apiVersion=2022-11-28), our tool adeptly mines issues from GitHub repositories. It allows users to define specific search criteria, ensuring targeted and efficient data extraction tailored to your research needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advanced Topic Modeling**: At the core of our approach is the use of the [Transformers library](https://pypi.org/project/transformers/) from Hugging Face, renowned for its extensive range of pre-trained BERT models. For our topic modeling, we employ the [all-mpnet-base-v2 model](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2), a powerful encoder-based transformer known for its accuracy and efficiency in handling complex language data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Clustering Descriptions with GPT-4**: To add depth and clarity to our analysis, we integrate OpenAI's GPT-4, a cutting-edge decoder-based transformer. This AI model significantly enhances the descriptions of extracted keywords for each topic, providing richer, more insightful interpretations of the data clusters."
